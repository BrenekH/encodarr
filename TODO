Client Side:
	Auto Updating Information:
		✔ Properly handle status_update @done(20-06-16 13:32)
		☐ Properly handle connect_info
		☐ Properly handle file_complete
		☐ Properly handle file_skip

Server Side:
	Send state of all files when client connects:
		☐ Implement queue between RedCedar and Web Server
		☐ RedCedar emits "connect_info" event when queue has new connection string
			☐ Only does once per loop to prevent oversending info to clients
	Misc:
		☐ Strip floating points from timestamps
